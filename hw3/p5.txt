a.  The frequency response of a delta function is a constant 
b.  see p5.xls sheet "p5b"
c.  for a wider box filter, the magnitude of the frequency components is scaled larger
d.  the fourier transform of a constant signal is an impulse response
e.  the addition of a cosine signal to b(x) modulates the magnitude in the frequeny domains, because the cosines components are added or subtracted
f.  b(x) is just scaled by 10.
g.  the magnitude is unaffected, while the phase spectrum is shifted compared to the original b(x). 
h.  the magnitude is again unaffected by the shift, but the phase is again shifted.
